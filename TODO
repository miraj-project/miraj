* rename data.xml to miraj.data.xml+ or miraj.data._ml or miraj.doc.xml+

* rename miraj/html.clj to miraj/html/polymer.clj

* add css DSL?  e.g. "div {color:red;}" =>  (css/div {:color :red})

  selectors:

      div#foo {} =>  (css/div :foo ...)

      #foo {} => (css/# :foo ...)

      foo > bar {} =>  (css/> foo bar ...)

      but a better way is to treat selectors as predicates rather than ctors:

      (css [preds ...] {:foo :bar})

      that's pretty much how garden does it
