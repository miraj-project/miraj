# miraj

Webcomponents, the Clojure way

Currently only link:https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/[Polymer].

Motivation:

Polymer is heavily invested in the Javascript ecosystem; to intall it,
you have to install `node`, `npm`, `bower`, etc.  That's a lot of
installation and configuration of stuff a Clojure programmer usually
does not want or need to deal with.  Miraj is intended to make
life slightly less horrible for Clojure/Clojurescript developers, who
can use it instead of going through the
link:https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/start/getting-the-code.html[Polymer
intallation rituals].

## Usage

Leiningen dependency:

----
[miraj "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]
----

In a web app, the miraj jar file is included in the classpath, so
you can use standard techniques for loading resources.

One easy way to do this is to "require" `[ring.middleware.resource
:refer [wrap-resource]]` and use it like so:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns myapp.core
  (:require [ring.middleware.resource :refer [wrap-resource]]
  ...)
  ...

(def app
  (-> app-routes
    (wrap-resource "/")))
----

This makes the polymer library available at the app root `/`.  Then
edit your HTML `<script src="...">` and `<link href="...">` to refer
correctly; for example, using hiccup:

[source,clojure]
----
    [:script {:src "polymer/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-lite.js"}]
----
